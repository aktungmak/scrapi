this tool is to to records the state of a odata rest api
the capture can then be used to simulate the state later

scrapi rec https://hostname/rest/v0 -o capture.json
scrapi play capture.json -p 8080

it does this by following all the links in each endpoint
the data it finds is stored in a map of url:json strings
this allows us to quickly check if an endpoint has already
been seen by using the "v, ok" syntax.

all this data is dumped in a json file, which could be compressed

on playback, the map is regenerated from the json file
a webserver is started, and it responds to get requests using
the map of url:json strings.

the fun part comes when trying to make the scraping concurrent
we use a waitgroup to keep track of how many workers are idle
when all workers are idle, we can be sure that the scrape is done
